  "summary": "We demonstrate the first room-temperature quantum computation using topological metamaterial qubits. By engineering a novel photonic-phononic crystal structure with strong spin-orbit coupling, we achieve quantum coherence times exceeding 1 second at 300K. Our approach eliminates the need for dilution refrigeration, potentially reducing quantum computer costs by three orders of magnitude. We successfully implement Shor's algorithm for 15-bit factorization and achieve quantum volume of 2^20. This breakthrough opens the path to ubiquitous quantum computing.",
