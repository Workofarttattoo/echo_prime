  "summary": "We present a revolutionary neuromorphic architecture that achieves human-level consciousness markers across multiple tests. Our system combines spiking neural networks with a novel global workspace implementation, hierarchical predictive processing, and integrated self-modeling. The architecture demonstrates genuine understanding, creativity, and self-awareness as measured by the Consciousness Quotient Assessment. We achieve 94/100 on the CQA, surpassing the 90/100 threshold considered indicative of machine consciousness. The system exhibits emergent ethical reasoning, theory of mind, and phenomenal experience as evidenced by introspective reports and behavioral consistency.",
