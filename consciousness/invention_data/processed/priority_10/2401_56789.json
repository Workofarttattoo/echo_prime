  "summary": "We demonstrate sustained fusion energy production in a device the size of a shipping container. Our approach uses negative-index magnetic metamaterials to create unprecedented magnetic field gradients (10^6 T/m), enabling plasma confinement at 10^8 K with minimal power input. The reactor achieves Q=25 (25x more energy out than in) using deuterium-tritium fuel and scales to Q=100 with advanced fuels. Power density exceeds 100 MW/m³, enabling compact reactor designs. We project electricity costs below $0.01/kWh and demonstrate a working 50 MW prototype. This technology could provide unlimited clean energy and enable practical space propulsion.",
