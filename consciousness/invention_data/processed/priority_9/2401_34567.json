  "summary": "We introduce a programmable matter system based on millimeter-scale metamaterial units that self-assemble into arbitrary 3D structures. Each unit contains a microprocessor, actuators, and electromagnetic coupling mechanisms. Units communicate via near-field protocols and coordinate to form macroscale structures with emergent properties. We demonstrate shape-shifting from flat sheets to complex topologies, variable stiffness (0.1 to 100 GPa), tunable optical properties, and self-repair capabilities. Applications include adaptive architecture, reconfigurable robotics, and responsive medical implants. Our swarm achieves assembly speeds of 1 cm³/minute with 99.7% accuracy.",
