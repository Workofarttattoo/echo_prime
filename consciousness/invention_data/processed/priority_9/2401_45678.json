  "summary": "We report a breakthrough brain-computer interface achieving 1 Tbps bidirectional communication with the human brain. Our approach uses an injectable optogenetic mesh that self-assembles across neural tissue, combining femtosecond laser stimulation with voltage-sensitive fluorescent readout. The mesh achieves single-neuron resolution across 10^7 neurons simultaneously. Human trials (n=5) demonstrate thought-to-text at 200 words per minute with 99.2% accuracy, direct sensory injection (vision, touch, proprioception), and bidirectional memory read/write. Subjects report seamless integration with no adverse effects. This technology enables direct human-AI collaboration and could treat paralysis, blindness, and neurological disorders.",
