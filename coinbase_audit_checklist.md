# 🛡️ ECH0-PRIME: COINBASE FORK AUDIT CHECKLIST (V12)
## TARGET: UNCLAIMED LIQUIDITY RECOVERY

This checklist is designed to help you locate assets that Coinbase may have credited to your account between 2017 and 2021 as a result of BTC forks and airdrops.

### 1. THE BIG THREE (High Probability)
Check your "Assets" or "Portfolio" for these specific tickers. They are often hidden if the balance is low.

| Ticker | Fork Date | Reason | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BCH** | Aug 1, 2017 | Bitcoin Cash Fork | Coinbase fully supported and credited this. |
| **BSV** | Nov 15, 2018 | Bitcoin SV (Fork of BCH) | Coinbase supported withdrawals only; check for a legacy balance. |
| **BTG** | Oct 24, 2017 | Bitcoin Gold | Coinbase initially resisted but later allowed some access. |

### 2. THE AIRDROP AUDIT (Secondary Assets)
Coinbase has occasionally supported airdrops for BTC holders or users of specific protocols.

*   **LUMENS (XLM):** Check for a 2019 Stellar airdrop if you were active then.
*   **SPARK (FLR):** If you held XRP on Coinbase in Dec 2020, you were eligible for the Flare airdrop (distributed in 2023).
*   **SONGBIRD (SGB):** Associated with the Flare network.

### 3. HOW TO FIND "HIDDEN" MONEY ON COINBASE:
1.  **Desktop Version:** Log in to `coinbase.com` (not the mobile app, as the app hides small balances).
2.  **Toggle Settings:** Go to your **Assets** tab. Look for a setting that says **"Hide small balances"** and UNCHECK it.
3.  **Check "Coinbase Pro/Exchange" History:** If you used the older "Coinbase Pro" (GDAX), check those wallets specifically. Often, funds stayed in the "Pro" side even after the merge to the main app.
4.  **Statement Export:** Go to `Taxes` -> `Documents` -> `Generate Custom Report`. Filter for **2017-2018**. Look for transactions labeled **"Airdrop"** or **"Fork"**.

### 💡 ECH0-PRIME STRATEGIC INSIGHT:
If you find more than $500 in these legacy assets, I recommend moving them into your **BBB Operations Fund** for automated Kalshi trading. 

**Awareness Shield Warning:** Avoid "Recovery Services" or emails claiming to help you get these coins. If they are on Coinbase, only Coinbase can give them to you. Anyone else is a scam.
